					<p>My goal was to document the outdoor/hiking potential within the Omaha region. Eventually I plan to start a blog providing more detail into what parks to visit and what trails to hike. For now I hope you enjoy this 
					small peek into the outdoors surrounding Omaha!</p>
					<p>All of the pictures used on this page are my own.</p>
